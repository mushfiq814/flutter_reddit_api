Please fully read this before commenting, we'll try to keep it concise.\n\nNote that this is a repost, as the previous thread didn't get much attention which kinda defeats the point ([link](https://www.reddit.com/r/android/comments/dn16cg)). We'll take all feedback into consideration, no matter which thread you use.\n\n---\n\n## Our rules have been slightly reworded\n\nWe went over our rules and **slightly reworded/simplified some** of them. The idea is **to make them clearer**, and **easier to understand**, and have the important information in the sidebar. This also makes them more consistent with the way we moderate, and should serve as a point of reference to the rest of this thread.\n\n\n## What's the rationale behind our most important rules?\n\nThese three rules are often misunderstood, so we tried to clarify them a bit.\n\n\n- **Rule 2 (not allowing tech support)**: separating subreddits is the best way to **allow users to choose what they want to see**, as filters are either lacking or not available depending on the platform/app you're using. Most rule-breaking threads belong in r/AndroidQuestions or r/PickAnAndroidForMe, and we remove those while redirecting users to the appropriate subreddit. Some users don't like the separation as it means their tech-support questions get less attention, which we try to address as much as possible via the weekly threads and our sidebar. We don't think [the alternative](https://www.reddit.com/r/Android+AndroidQuestions+PickAnAndroidForMe+AndroidGaming+AndroidThemes+AndroidApps+AndroidDev) would be acceptable to most r/Android subscribers -- **allowing all posts means users can no longer subscribe to the content they're interested in**.\n\n-\n\n- **Rule 5 (no rehosted content)**: this is generally to ensure the original article's authors get rewarded for their efforts. The only exceptions we allow are when the source is not in English, or when the article adds substantial information to the original.\n\n-\n\n- **Rule 9 (offensive comments)**: this is necessary to keep r/Android a civil place. Criticizing others or their opinions is fine, but don't resort to insults.\n\nThere are **two important things to note** here:\n\n- **We rely on your reports** to enforce most of our rules. Please report posts and comments that break rules, especially for rule 9.\n\n- We consider rules 2 and 9 especially to be essential to the subreddit, although the way we enforce them may need refining depending on your views.\n\n\n## What do you think about rule 1?\n\n**Rule 1 (what's off-topic?) has some exceptions** that were added after a community poll. Those exceptions are:\n\n- ... allowing all:\n    - Google-related news with some relation to Android even if not direct (e.g. ChromeOS, Google Mini, etc).\n    - Discussions about generic phone accessories (e.g. headphones, battery packs).\n    - Posts about deals/discounts, SoCs (Snapdragon, Mediatek, etc) and benchmarks.\n    - Posts about businesses/finances of OEMs.\n- ... and not allowing:\n    - Posts about carriers (Verizon, Sprint, etc)\n\nWe think those mostly make sense, but it might be a good idea to revise them. **Would you be interested in another community poll? What should it contain?**\n\n\n## What do you think about our sticky threads?\n\nEspecially for the weekly threads, would you like to see any changes or additions?\n\n\n## What do you think about our rules in general?\n\nWould you like to see something changed? **Please explain why.**\n\nIf you're going to suggest any changes to rule 2, please keep in mind our rationale explained above, as any changes should ideally keep it possible for users to subscribe to the content they're interested in.\n\n\n## Any other general feedback about the sub?\n\nIs there anything you think we should be doing better? **Do you have any other suggestions?**\n\n## What's next?\n\nThis thread will be stickied for a few days. (We won't sticky it during the first few hours due to Reddit's algorithms and threads not showing up in Hot in that case.)\n\nThere will be follow-up threads/polls depending on the feedback and suggestions you guys raise, probably during one (or more) of the coming weekends to allow most people to participate.\n\n---\n\n**Why did you remove my post / why do you never approve my posts?**\n\nProbably because of rule 2. There should be a removal reason left by a mod on your removed thread explaining the reason, and redirecting you to appropriate subreddits sometimes. Also, sometimes we make mistakes, so [get in touch](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAndroid) if you think that's the case.\n\n---\n\nThanks!\n— The r/Android mod team",

Criticizing others or their opinions is fine, but don&amp;#39;t resort to insults.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are &lt;strong&gt;two important things to note&lt;/strong&gt; here:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We rely on your reports&lt;/strong&gt; to enforce most of our rules. Please report posts and comments that break rules, especially for rule 9.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;We consider rules 2 and 9 especially to be essential to the subreddit, although the way we enforce them may need refining depending on your views.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;What do you think about rule 1?&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rule 1 (what&amp;#39;s off-topic?) has some exceptions&lt;/strong&gt; that were added after a community poll. Those exceptions are:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;... allowing all:\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Google-related news with some relation to Android even if not direct (e.g. ChromeOS, Google Mini, etc).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Discussions about generic phone accessories (e.g. headphones, battery packs).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Posts about deals/discounts, SoCs (Snapdragon, Mediatek, etc) and benchmarks.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Posts about businesses/finances of OEMs.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;... and not allowing:\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Posts about carriers (Verizon, Sprint, etc)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We think those mostly make sense, but it might be a good idea to revise them. &lt;strong&gt;Would you be interested in another community poll? What should it contain?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;What do you think about our sticky threads?&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Especially for the weekly threads, would you like to see any changes or additions?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;What do you think about our rules in general?&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Would you like to see something changed? &lt;strong&gt;Please explain why.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re going to suggest any changes to rule 2, please keep in mind our rationale explained above, as any changes should ideally keep it possible for users to subscribe to the content they&amp;#39;re interested in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Any other general feedback about the sub?&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Is there anything you think we should be doing better? &lt;strong&gt;Do you have any other suggestions?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;What&amp;#39;s next?&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This thread will be stickied for a few days. (We won&amp;#39;t sticky it during the first few hours due to Reddit&amp;#39;s algorithms and threads not showing up in Hot in that case.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There will be follow-up threads/polls depending on the feedback and suggestions you guys raise, probably during one (or more) of the coming weekends to allow most people to participate.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why did you remove my post / why do you never approve my posts?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Probably because of rule 2. There should be a removal reason left by a mod on your removed thread explaining the reason, and redirecting you to appropriate subreddits sometimes. Also, sometimes we make mistakes, so &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAndroid\"&gt;get in touch&lt;/a&gt; if you think that&amp;#39;s the case.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks!\n— The &lt;a href=\"/r/Android\"&gt;r/Android&lt;/a&gt; mod team&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
